How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Focusing only in changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Learning about past mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You have total control and tracking over changes. Just the correct quantity of commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because, in code for example, you need to keep tracking over a group of files that have interaction between its components.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Combining both commands getting commit IDs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can explore changes without breaking anything.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Current and future jobs.
